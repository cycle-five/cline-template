# Getting Started with Cline Template

This guide will help you set up and customize this template repository for your specific project, enabling you to work effectively with AI assistants like Cline.

## Initial Setup

1. **Create a new repository from this template**
   - Click the "Use this template" button on GitHub
   - Name your new repository and create it

2. **Clone your new repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

3. **Set up your project structure**
   - Create directories for your project files (src/, tests/, docs/, etc.)
   - Add any necessary configuration files (.gitignore, etc.)

## Customizing the Memory Bank

The `memory_bank` directory contains markdown files that provide context to AI assistants. Customize each file with your project's specific details:

### project_brief.md

This file should contain a high-level overview of your project:

- Project name and description
- Core features and functionality
- Target users or audience
- Technical preferences or constraints

### tech_context.md

Document your project's technical details:

- Technology stack (languages, frameworks, libraries)
- Development environment setup
- Data storage solutions
- Logging, error handling, and testing approaches
- Deployment and performance considerations

### product_context.md

Outline your product vision:

- Overall product vision and goals
- User personas and journeys
- Feature prioritization and roadmap

### system_patterns.md

Describe your system's architecture:

- High-level architecture diagram or description
- Design patterns used in the project
- Data flow through the system
- Error handling and concurrency models
- Testing and deployment strategies

### active_context.md

Keep this file updated with your current development focus:

- Current sprint or development focus
- Recent changes or implementations
- Known issues or limitations
- Next steps or upcoming work

### progress.md

Track your project's progress:

- Implemented features and functionality
- Pending or in-progress work
- Future plans and backlog items

## Updating .clinerules

The `.clinerules` file helps AI assistants understand your project configuration:

1. Open `.clinerules` in your editor
2. Update the "Tech Stack" section with your project's technologies
3. Add your project structure (you can use `tree .` to generate this)
4. Include any database or environment information
5. Specify your preferred development workflow

## Best Practices for Working with AI Assistants

1. **Be specific in your requests**
   - Clearly state what you want the AI to help with
   - Provide context about why you need the help

2. **Keep documentation updated**
   - Update the memory bank files as your project evolves
   - Especially update active_context.md before each session

3. **Provide feedback**
   - Let the AI know when its suggestions are helpful or not
   - Clarify any misunderstandings

4. **Use consistent terminology**
   - Be consistent in how you refer to components and concepts
   - This helps the AI build a coherent understanding of your project

5. **Break down complex tasks**
   - For complex problems, break them into smaller, manageable pieces
   - This helps the AI provide more focused assistance

## Example Workflow

1. Update `active_context.md` with your current focus
2. Start a session with the AI assistant
3. Reference specific files or components you're working on
4. Ask for specific help (code review, implementation ideas, debugging)
5. Implement suggestions and provide feedback
6. Update `progress.md` with completed work

By following these guidelines, you'll create a productive environment for collaborating with AI assistants on your project.
