## Memory Bank Structure

The `memory_bank` directory contains several markdown files that help provide context to AI assistants:

- **projectBrief.md**: High-level overview of your project, its goals, and requirements
- **techContext.md**: Technical details about your project's stack, architecture, and environment
- **productContext.md**: Information about your product vision, user personas, and feature priorities
- **systemPatterns.md**: Details about your system's architecture, design patterns, and data flow
- **activeContext.md**: Current development focus, recent changes, and known issues

## Best Practices
